=== Remote WildFly Arquillian container adapter

==== How to run
1. Start your WildFly 10 instance
2. Run this maven command: `mvn clean verify` or run the test as a JUnit test in your IDE. You can run the test as many time as you want without stopping the container.
3. Stop the container

The container resides in a separate JVM and its lifecycle (startup/shutdown) is managed by the user. Arquillian only binds to the container to deploy the test archive and invokes tests via a remote protocol; after the test run the archive is also undeployed.
